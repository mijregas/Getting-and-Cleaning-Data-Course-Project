# CodeBook for the Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The data for the project was downloaded as a Zip file from:<br>
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
  
Once unzipped into the "./data" directory, the data consists of 28 files in 4 folders. For purposes of this assignments, the raw data contained in the Inertial Signals directories was ignored. The remaining files of interest were contained in a directory structure as depicted below under the "root" directory "UCI HAR Dataset".

UCI HAR Dataset
+-- Test
    +-- Inertial Signals
	    subject_test.txt
		X_test.txt
		y_test.txt
+-- Train
    +-- Inertial Signals
	    subject_train.txt
		X_train.txt
		y_train.txt
    activity_labels.txt
	features.txt
	features_info.txt
	README.txt

The files X_test.txt (2947 lines/rows) and X_train.txt (7352 lines/rows) contain the raw accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial signals and the other "features" recorded for the experiment. Each observation or row in these two data files contains 561 individual data values. 

The file features.txt contains a complete listing of the variable names for each of the 561 data points in each row of the X_test.txt and X_train.txt data files. For this exercise or project, I was only concerned with extracting the variables recording mean and standard deviations for the following variables or "signals" described in features_info.txt:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag	

'-XYZ' in the variable names above denotes 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. 

One strategy in working with these files was to create a vector of column headings from the variable names in features.txt. Unfortunately, this wasn't as easy as I'd hoped. First, the name strings in the file contained problematic characters -- in particular, dashes (minus signs), commas, and parentheses. These were removed, but, even worse, there were duplicate variable names -- for example "fBodyAcc-bandsEnergy()-1,8" appears 3 times (lines 303, 317, and 331). These "bandsEnergy" duplicate name issues made it necessary to remove unwanted columns before using a vector subset of the variable names as column headings.
	
The files subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt are effectively vectors of the subject numbers associated with the observations in the "X_test.txt" (2947 observations) and the X_train.txt (7352 observations) files.

The files y_test.txt and y_train.txt again are vectors containing the activity identifiers (activity numbers) associated with the observations in the "X_test.txt" (2947 observations) and the X_train.txt (7352 observations) files.
	
In total, there were (8*6 + 9*2) = 66 data columns selected from the "X" files. In addition, the respective subject numbers, activity identifiers, and activity names were added to an intermediate file of dimensions [10299 x 69]. 
	
The intermediate file was grouped by subject and activity then summarized within groups by averaging the signal data within each group. When displayed, the output of the run_analysis() function is as follows:
